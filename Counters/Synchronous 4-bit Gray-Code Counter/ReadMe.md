# Synchronous 4-bit Gray-Code Counter

## About
A Gray-Code counter counts in such a manner that the difference between
any two consecutive states only differs by 1 bit. It is used in a variety of
scenarios especially where bit variations/state changes are prohibitive in
terms of resource costs

## Steps
• First, make a state table for the scheme that your counter follows.

• Calculate the number of SR Flip-Flops required.

• Assign values to the inputs S, R for each of the Flip-Flops.

• Use Karnaugh Maps to achieve minimized expressions for the inputs.

• Write Verilog code for this counter

### The steps are covered and explained in *Digital-Electronics/Counters/Counters Report VanshGupta.pdf*
